# DiscriminatoryEquality Manifesto:
1. The discriminatory practices that government, administration, society adopts in a region.
2. Calculate the discrimination index based on how many people are affected, how frequently they are discriminated.
3. Relate the discriminatory practice to the legal provision, governance rules, society norms which encourage the 
discrimination masqueraded as equality measures.
4. Highlight the discrimination to the change-making agents, authorities.
